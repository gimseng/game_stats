# Get Data

This documentation provides details of the Python codes needed to generate the data in [data/raw](https://github.com/gimseng/game_stats/blob/master/data/raw).

There are three steps to the process:
1. [get_game_list.py](https://github.com/gimseng/game_stats/blob/master/src/data/get_game_list.py): The website contains a search function whereby if no search text is enetered, it will generate all the game with their summary info. This code makes use of this to allow us to obtain their game ID and store them (or rather the link to each of the game's page) in a list (which is in the [list_game_url.csv](https://github.com/gimseng/game_stats/blob/master/data/interim/list_game_url.csv) file). The sets up all the game links the codes will have to scrap in the next stage.
